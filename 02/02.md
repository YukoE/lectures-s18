# Introduction to Programming

### Python

For the remainder of class we will be learning a high-level programming language called **Python**.

## What is a Programming language?

### Assembly

* Computers run programs written in low-level language called *assembly*
* Assembly code is very fast and efficient but:
    * The code is not portable between different operating systems
    * The code is difficult to write and read

### Assembly "Hello, World"
This is a program for printing the text "Hello, World" in assembly:

```fasm
global    _start

section   .text
_start:   mov       rax, 1
mov       rdi, 1
mov       rsi, message
mov       rdx, 13
syscall         
mov       rax, 60
xor       rdi, rdi
syscall        

section   .data
message:  db        "Hello, World", 10
```

### Programming languages

* People created "higher level" programming languages to make our (programmers') lives easier:
    * Stata, SAS, SPSS
    * R
    * Shell
    * Python
    * Java
    * C, C++

### Interpretter vs Compiler

* There are two basic ways of translating high-level languages into low-level languages:
    * Interpretter: Code is read and translated and executed line by line (e.g. shell, Python, R)
    * Compiler: Code is read all at once and translated before it is executed
* Generally interpretted languages are easier to read and write but may be slower

### Interpretted "Hello, World"

* Shell:
```bash
echo Hello, World
```

* Python:
```python
print("Hello, World")
```

* R:
```R
print("Hello, World')
```

### Compiled "Hello, World"
* C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
### Language choice
:::incremental
* People have preferences for programming languages just like they do for anything else
* Sometimes these preferences are based on objective criteria
    * e.g. speed or efficiency or portability
* But often they're subjective
    * e.g. many people think that python code is very easy to read and write
* And there are many myths
    * e.g. you'll hear people say that python is faster than R
    * it's not exactly true
:::

### Why Python?
In this class we'll use python because it has proven over time to be:

* Easy (relatively) to learn
* Works well for many policy tasks (data analysis, text mining, visualization, modeling, etc.)
* Scales to large applications/datasets
* Has a large developer community

## Python

### Interactive Interpretter

* Simple way of running python
* Interactively enter text commands like the command line itself
* Like a calculator

```python
$ python
Python 3.6 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

```

### Using python as a calculator:

### String manipulation

### Lists, Dictionaries

### Executing a script

### Jupyter notebook
