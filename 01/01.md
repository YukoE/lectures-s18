# Overview

## Why learn programming?
### Do things better

* Automation
    * Automate downloading and merging and cleaning of data
* Speed
* Collaboration using git
* Clarity and reproducibility


### Do new things
* Data sources
    * web APIs, web scraping, databases, geographic data, etc.)
* Visualizations
* Models
    * ``machine learning''

### Why now?
* Software is easier and more powerful than ever
* More data is publicly available than ever
    * e.g. municipal data portals
* More organizations are using these tools

### Operating System

* Does things that the user doesn't need or want to deal with
* Makes system more efficient and convenient
* Intermediary between user and hardware

### Unix

* In the 1970s AT&T Bell Labs developed an operating system called Unix
* The code was licensed to academic (Berkeley) and commercial (IBM, Sun) vendors who created Unix variants
* Today there are many Unix variants
    * Linux is an open-source Unix developed by Linus Torvalds in the 1980s
        * Google's Android is based on Linux, making Linux (and Unix) the most popular operating system in the world
    * Mac OS X is also a Unix variant
    * Windows is *not* Unix
        * We'll use Cygwin to provide a "Unix-like" environment

### Command Line

* One of the essential features of Unix for users is its command line (or shell)
* This is a text interface for executing commands
* It hides the details of the underlying operating system
* The Unix shell has 

### Bash
