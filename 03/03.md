# Lists

## List operations: `+`

Can concatenate lists just like strings:
```python
>>> [1, 2, 3] + ['a', 'b', 'c']
[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']
```

## List operations: `*`

Can also repeat a list with `*`:
```python
>>> [0] * 5
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1,2,3] * 2
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

## List slices
As with strings we can slice lists. Note that, as with strings, we can omit either end: the slice will then start at the beginning or end at the end of the list.

```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> a[2:]
['c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> a[:3]
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## List `append`
```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> a.append('d')
>>> a
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

## List `extend`
```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> a.extend(['d', 'e', 'f'])
>>> a
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

## List `sort`

The `sort` function sorts the list:
```python
>>> a = [15, 11, 2, 23, 13]
>>> a.sort()
>>> a
[2, 11, 13, 15, 23]
```

## Inplace
Note that the above list functions (`append`, `extend`, `sort`) modify the functions *inplace* and return `None`.

## Removing elements
```python
>>> a = ['a','b','c','d']
>>> a.remove('d')         # remove by value
>>> a
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> a.pop(1)              # by index and return value
'b'
>>> a
['a', 'c']
```


## Median
We can use sorting to find the median in a list. Sort and take the middle value:
```python
>>> a = [15, 11, 2, 23, 13]
>>> b = sorted(a)
>>> b[round(len(b)/2)-1]
15
```

## Percentile
More generally, we can find an arbitrary percentile `p`:
```python
>>> b = sorted(a)
>>> b[round(len(b)*p)-1]
```
Note that this is a crude version of percentile-- in practice we use interpolation to refine.

# String parsing

## What is parsing?
The process of reading through a string to break it down or interpret it is called *parsing*.

* Command line programs do this in order to interpret options and arguments
* Python does this to execute your code
* Google does it to execute a search query
* Etc.

## String parsing example
```python
city_state = 'Chicago, IL'

if ',' not in city_state: # substring
    raise ValueError('no comma')

comma_index = city_state.find(',')
city = city_state[:comma_index]
state = city_state[comma_index+2:]

if len(state) != 2:
    raise ValueError('invalid state abbrev: ' + state)

print('City:', city)
print('State:', state)
```

## More string functions
:::incremental
* `string.endswith(ending)`: does `string` end in `ending`?
* `string.startswith(beginning)`: does `string` start with `beginning`?
* `substring in string`: does `string` contain `substring`?
* `string.find(substring)`: what is the (first!) index of `substring` in `string`? (or -1 if `substring not in string`)
:::

## Command Line Arguments
A python script can use command line arguments through the `argv` list in the `sys` module:
```python
# cmd_args.py
import sys
print(sys.argv)
```

```bash
$ python cmd_args.py -o -h arguments
['cmd_args.py', '-o', '-h', 'arguments']
```

# Example: Reading a CSV file

## Opening a file
Open a file using the `open` function:
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> print(file)
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='salaries.csv' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>
```
This `TextIOWrapper` object facilitates I/O (input/output).

## Reading a line
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> file.readline()
'Name,Job Titles,Department,Full or Part-Time,Salary or Hourly,Typical Hours,Annual Salary,Hourly Rate\n'
```

The `\n` character is the *line feed* character. It is a single character. We can remove it by indexing `[:-1]`.

## Reading many lines
You can iterate over the lines in a file similarly to a list:
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> lines = []
>>> for line in file:
...    lines.append(line[:-1])

['Name,Job Titles,Department,Full or Part-Time,Salary or Hourly,Typical Hours,Annual Salary,Hourly Rate',
 '"AARON,  JEFFERY M",SERGEANT,POLICE,F,Salary,,$101442.00,',
 '"AARON,  KARINA ",POLICE OFFICER (ASSIGNED AS DETECTIVE),POLICE,F,Salary,,$94122.00,',
...]
```

## Splitting fields
This list of lines is not very useful for analysis. The first step is to break up the lines into fields.
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> line = file.readline()[:-1]
>>> line.split(',')
['Name',
 'Job Titles',
 'Department',
 'Full or Part-Time',
 'Salary or Hourly',
 'Typical Hours',
 'Annual Salary',
 'Hourly Rate']

## 2d list
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> lines = []
>>> for line in file:
...     fields = line[:-1].split(',')
...     lines.append(fields)
>>> lines
[['Name',
  'Job Titles',
  'Department',
  'Full or Part-Time',
  'Salary or Hourly',
  'Typical Hours',
  'Annual Salary',
  'Hourly Rate'],
 ['"AARON',
  '  JEFFERY M"',
  'SERGEANT',
  'POLICE',
  'F',
  'Salary',
  '',
  '$101442.00',
  ''],
...]
```

## 2d lists
:::incremental
* `lines` above is a two dimensional (2d) list
* We can subset the columns using `lines[2]` or a group of columns with a slice `lines[2:4]`
* We can subset rows using `lines[:][5]` or `lines[:][5:10]`
* We can subset rows and columns using `lines[2:4][5:10]` 
:::

## Further string parsing
:::incremental
* The 2d list is an improvement but there's more work to do
* Extra characters (double quotes in the names)
* Numbers like salaries are still strings
* In the future we'll use existing python modules to parse CSVs

# Dictionaries

## What is a dictionary?

:::incremental
* Another python data structure is a *dictionary* (called a hashmap in some languages).
* In a list, indices are integers.
* In a dictionary, indices can take almost any type.

:::

## More on dictionaries
* A dictionary can also be thought of as a mapping between *keys* (indices) and *values*.
* Each key maps to a value. The keys are unique but the values need not be.
* The combination of a key and a value is called a *key-value pair* or an *item*.
