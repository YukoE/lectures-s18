# Lists

## List operations: `+`

Can concatenate lists just like strings:
```python
>>> [1, 2, 3] + ['a', 'b', 'c']
[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']
```

## List operations: `*`

Can also repeat a list with `*`:
```python
>>> [0] * 5
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1,2,3] * 2
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

## List operator: `in`
You can check whether a value is in a list using the `in` operator:
```python
>>> ls = [1,3,5,7]
>>> 3 in ls
True
>>> 4 in ls
False
```

## List slices
As with strings we can slice lists. Note that, as with strings, we can omit either end: the slice will then start at the beginning or end at the end of the list.

```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> a[2:]
['c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> a[:3]
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## List `append`
```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> a.append('d')
>>> a
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

## List `extend`
```python
>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> a.extend(['d', 'e', 'f'])
>>> a
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

## List `sort`

The `sort` function sorts the list:
```python
>>> a = [15, 11, 2, 23, 13]
>>> a.sort()
>>> a
[2, 11, 13, 15, 23]
```

## Inplace
Note that the above list functions (`append`, `extend`, `sort`) modify the functions *inplace* and return `None`.

## Removing elements
Two ways to remove elements from a list:

:::incremental
*  Remove by value:

    ```python
    >>> a = ['a','b','c','d']
    >>> a.remove('d')
    >>> a
    ['a', 'b', 'c']
    ```
* Remove by index and return value: 

    ```python
    >>> a.pop(1)
    'b'
    >>> a
    ['a', 'c']
    ```
:::

## Median
We can use sorting to find the median in a list. Sort and take the middle value:
```python
>>> a = [15, 11, 2, 23, 13]
>>> b = sorted(a)
>>> b[round(len(b)/2)-1]
15
```

## Percentile
More generally, we can find an arbitrary percentile `p`:
```python
>>> b = sorted(a)
>>> b[round(len(b)*p)-1]
```
Note that this is a crude version of percentile-- in practice we use interpolation to refine.

# String parsing

## What is parsing?
The process of reading through a string to break it down or interpret it is called *parsing*.

* Command line programs do this in order to interpret options and arguments
* Python does this to execute your code
* Google does it to execute a search query
* Etc.

## String parsing example
```python
city_state = 'Chicago, IL'

if ',' not in city_state: # substring
    raise ValueError('no comma')

comma_index = city_state.find(',')
city = city_state[:comma_index]
state = city_state[comma_index+2:]

if len(state) != 2:
    raise ValueError('invalid state abbrev: ' + state)

print('City:', city)
print('State:', state)
```

## More string functions
:::incremental
* `string.endswith(ending)`: does `string` end in `ending`?
* `string.startswith(beginning)`: does `string` start with `beginning`?
* `substring in string`: does `string` contain `substring`?
* `string.find(substring)`: what is the (first!) index of `substring` in `string`? (or -1 if `substring not in string`)
:::

## Command Line Arguments
A python script can use command line arguments through the `argv` list in the `sys` module:
```python
# cmd_args.py
import sys
print(sys.argv)
```

```bash
$ python cmd_args.py -o -h arguments
['cmd_args.py', '-o', '-h', 'arguments']
```

# Example: Reading a CSV file

## Opening a file
Open a file using the `open` function:
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> print(file)
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='salaries.csv' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>
```
This `TextIOWrapper` object facilitates I/O (input/output).

## Reading a line
* Read a line from the file:

    ```python
    >>> file = open('salaries.csv')
    >>> line = file.readline()
    >>> line
    'Name,Job Titles,Department,Full or Part-Time,
     Salary or Hourly,Typical Hours,Annual Salary,
     Hourly Rate\n'
    ```

* `\n` is the *line feed* character. It is a single character. One way to remove it in this example: 

    ```python
    >>> line[:-1]
    'Name,Job Titles,Department,Full or Part-Time,
     Salary or Hourly,Typical Hours,Annual Salary,
     Hourly Rate'
    ```

## Reading many lines
You can iterate over the lines in a file similarly to a list:
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> lines = []
>>> for line in file:
...    lines.append(line[:-1])

['Name,Job Titles,Department,Full or Part-Time,Salary or Hourly,Typical Hours,Annual Salary,Hourly Rate',
 '"AARON,  JEFFERY M",SERGEANT,POLICE,F,Salary,,$101442.00,',
 '"AARON,  KARINA ",POLICE OFFICER (ASSIGNED AS DETECTIVE),POLICE,F,Salary,,$94122.00,',
...]
```

## Splitting fields
This list of lines is not very useful for analysis. The first step is to break up the lines into fields.

```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> line = file.readline()[:-1]
>>> line.split(',')
['Name',
 'Job Titles',
 'Department',
 'Full or Part-Time',
 'Salary or Hourly',
 'Typical Hours',
 'Annual Salary',
 'Hourly Rate']
```

## 2d list
```python
>>> file = open('salaries.csv')
>>> lines = []
>>> for line in file:
...     fields = line[:-1].split(',')
...     lines.append(fields)
>>> lines
[['Name',
  'Job Titles',
  'Department',
  'Full or Part-Time',
  'Salary or Hourly',
  'Typical Hours',
  'Annual Salary',
  'Hourly Rate'],
 ['"AARON',
  '  JEFFERY M"',
  'SERGEANT',
  'POLICE',
  'F',
  'Salary',
  '',
  '$101442.00',
  ''],
...]
```

## 2d lists
:::incremental
* `lines` above is a two dimensional (2d) list
    * i.e. it is a list in which each item (a row) is itself a list (of fields)
* We can subset rows `lines[2]` or a group of columns with a slice `lines[2:4]`
* `lines[1:]` will return everything except the header
:::

## Aggregating
We can aggregate the number of full time employees:
```python
count = 0
for line in lines:
    if line[4] == 'F':
        count = count + 1
```

## Further string parsing
:::incremental
* The 2d list is an improvement but there's more work to do
* Extra characters (double quotes in the names)
* Numbers like salaries are still strings
* You'll do this in your assignment this week
* In the future we'll use existing python modules to parse CSVs

# Dictionaries

## What is a dictionary?

:::incremental
* Another python data structure is a *dictionary* (called a hashmap in some languages).
* In a list, indices are integers.
* In a dictionary, indices can take almost any type.
:::

## More on dictionaries
:::incremental
* A dictionary can also be thought of as a mapping between *keys* (indices) and *values*.
* Each key maps to a value. The keys are unique but the values need not be.
* The combination of a key and a value is called a *key-value pair* or an *item*.
:::

## `dict` construction
:::incremental
* Can construct a list using the `dict` function (so don't call your dictionaries `dict`):

    ```python
    >>> d = dict()
    >>> d
    {}
    ```
* `{}` is an empty dictionary. 
* Curly braces are the analogue for dicts of the square braces `[]` for lists.
:::

## Adding items to a dictionary
Add items to a dictionary using square brackets:

```python
>>> eng2esp = dict()
>>> eng2esp['one'] = 'uno'
>>> eng2esp
{'one': 'uno'}
```

Now `eng2esp` maps `'one'` to `'uno'`.

## Alternative dictionary constructor
You can also create a `dict` with curly brace syntax:
```python
>>> eng2esp = {'one':'uno', 'two':'dos', 'three':'tres'}
```

## Dictionaries are unordered
:::incremental
* Dictionaries are *unordered* meaning their items do not have a sequence:

    ```python
    >>> eng2esp = {'one':'uno', 'two':'dos', 'three':'tres'}
    >>> eng2esp
    {'one':'uno', 'three':'tres', 'two':'dos'}
    ```

* So you cannot rely on the order of elements in a dictionary. But it's okay because we index the elements using their keys, not their order:

    ```python
    >>> eng2esp['two']
    'dos'
    ```
:::

## `KeyError`
If you try to get a value for a non-existent `key` you'll get a `KeyError`:
```python
>>> eng2esp['four']
KeyError: 'four'
```
## `in` operator
To determine whether a key is in a dictionary you can use the `in` operator:
```python
>>> 'one' in eng2esp
True
>>> 'uno' in eng2esp
False
```

## Accessing keys and values
A dictionary has three useful "lists" associated with it:

:::incremental
* `keys()` is  like a list of the keys:

    ```python
    >>> eng2esp.keys()      
    dict_keys(['three', 'one', 'two'])
    ```
* `values()` is like a list of the values:

    ```python
    >>> eng2esp.values()
    dict_values(['tres', 'uno', 'dos'])
    ```
* `items()` is like list of lists, each of which is the pair (length 2) `[key, value]`:

    ```python
    >>> eng2esp.items()     # items is like a two dimensional list of [key, value]
    dict_items([('three', 'tres'), ('one', 'uno'), ('two', 'dos')])
    ```
