# Matching Problem

## Market design
* Most markets studied in ecoomics are decentralized
* Recently there has been interest in centralized markets:
    * placing students in schools
    * workers to firms
    * patients to organ donors

## Hospital Residency
* After graduating from medical school, students seek residencies (internships) at teaching hospitals
* For a long time, hospitals were in fierce competition for residents
    * They were pushing their offers back earlier and earlier

## N.R.M.P.
:::incremental
* In the 50s, the National Residency Matching Program (N.M.R.P.) was created
* Students and hospitals submit their ordered preference lists
* A computer program matches students to hospitals, using a variant of the Gale-Shapely algorithm that we'll cover later
:::

## Input
:::incremental
* $n$ students (e.g. $A$, $B$, and $C$) and $n$ hospitals ($X$, $Y$, and $Z$)
* Each student ranks each hospital
    
    Student  1st   2nd 3rd
    -------  ---   --- ---
    A         X     Y   Z
    B         Y     X   Z
    C         X     Y   Z

* Each hospital ranks each student

    Hospital  1st   2nd 3rd
    --------  ---   --- ---
    X          B     A   C
    Y          A     B   C
    Z          A     B   C

## Matching
A *matching* is set of pairs of students and hospitals, e.g. $(A, Z), (B, Y), (C, X)$

Student       1st             2nd               3rd
------------  -------------   ----------------- -----------------
A              X               Y                \color{red}Z
B             \color{red}Y              X                 Z
C             \color{red}X              Y                 Z


Hospital     1st              2nd                3rd
-----------  --------------   -----------------  --------------------
X            B                A                  \color{red}C
Y            A                \color{red}B       C
Z            \color{red}A      B                  C

## Unstable pair
:::incremental
* In a given matching, a student $s$ and hospital $h$ are an unstable pair if:
    * $h$ prefers $s$ to its current match
    * $s$ prefers $h$ to its current match
* E.g. (A, Y) are an unstable pair in the matching above:

    Student       1st             2nd               3rd
    ------------  -------------   ----------------- -----------------
    A              X               \color{blue}Y      \color{red}Z
    B             \color{red}Y              X                 Z
    C             \color{red}X              Y                 Z


    Hospital     1st              2nd                3rd
    -----------  --------------   -----------------  --------------------
    X            B                A                  \color{red}C
    Y            \color{blue}A    \color{red}B       C
    Z            \color{red}A      B                  C

:::
## Stable matching
A *stable matching* is one in which there are no unstable pairs

Student       1st             2nd               3rd
------------  -------------   ----------------- -----------------
A             \color{red}X        Y                Z
B             \color{red}Y              X                 Z
C             X                 Y                   \color{red}Z


Hospital     1st              2nd                3rd
-----------  --------------   -----------------  --------------------
X            B                \color{red}A       C
Y            A                \color{red}B       C
Z            A                B                  \color{red}C



# Gale-Shapely Algorithm

## Background
Gale and Shapely proposed a solution to the matching problem in their paper *College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage* (1962).

## Iteration

The algorithm is iterative. In each iteration, we consider a student $s$ and:

* `for` each hospital $h$ that $s$ has not yet proposed to
    * `if` $h$ is free
        * match $s$ to $h$
    * `else if` $h$ prefers $s$ to current match $s'$
        * free $s'$ and match $s$ to $h$

## Iteration condition
* The algorithm continues `while` a student is free and has a hospital they have not yet proposed to.

## Properties of algorithm
:::incremental
* There are at most $n^2$ (one for each possible student-hospital pair) proposals and so the algorithm will terminate.
* Every student and hospital gets a matched
* The algorithm produces a match with no unstable pairs
:::

## Non-uniqueness
:::incremental
* For a given set of preferences, there can be more than one stable matching
* The order in which the students are iterated over can affect *which* stable matching is selected
:::

## Asymmetry
* Favors students' preferences over hospitals

## Variations
* Married couples
* One hospital admits multiple residents

## 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics
Shapely and Alvin Roth, who applied the algorithm to hospitals, schools, and organ donors, shared the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for this work.

# Implementation

## Students and hospitals lists

```python
students = ['A', 'B', 'C']
hospitals = ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
```

## Preferences table

We can store the preferences

Student  1st   2nd 3rd
-------  ---   --- ---
A         X     Y   Z
B         Y     X   Z
C         X     Y   Z


Hospital  1st   2nd 3rd
--------  ---   --- ---
X          B     A   C
Y          A     B   C
Z          A     B   C

as a python dictionary.

## Preferences dictionary

```python
prefs = {
    'X': ['B', 'A', 'C'],
    'Y': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'Z': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'A': ['X', 'Y', 'Z'],
    'B': ['Y', 'X', 'Z'],
    'C': ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
}
```


## Pseudo-code

~~~ {.numberLines .python}
initialize M to be an empty matching
while there exists a free student:
   h = s’s top preference to which s hasn’t proposed
   if h free:
     add (s, h) to the match
   else
     some pair (s2, h) already exists
     if h prefers s to s2
        s2 becomes free
       (s, h) become matched
     else
       (s2, h) remain engaged
~~~

## Matching dictionary

~~~ {.numberLines .python}
initialize M to be an empty matching
~~~

:::incremental
* We can also use a dictionary to store the matching:

    ```python
    M = {}
    ```

* We can either use hospitals or students as keys (since the mapping is one-to-one). We'll use hospitals, so a possible matching would be:

    ```python
    M = {'X':'C', 'Y':'B', 'Z':'A'}
    ```
:::

## Free students

~~~ {.numberLines .python}
M = {}
while there exists a free student:
    ...
~~~

## Free students list

```python
free_students = ['A', 'B', 'C']
```

~~~ {.numberLines .python}
M = {}
while len(free_students) > 0:
~~~

## Proposals
~~~ {.numberLines .python}
M = {}
while len(free_students) > 0:
~~~

~~~ {.numberLines .python}
M = {}
while len(free_students) > 0:
   h = s’s top preference to which s hasn’t proposed
~~~

## List pop
:::incremental
* Note that `list.pop()` without a parameter removes and returns the *last* element in the list.

* Recall

    ```python
    >>> prefs['A']
    ['X', 'Y', 'Z']
    ```

* So `pop` would remove and return the *least* preferred hospital

* We simply *reverse* our preference lists so that the most preferred hospital is last:

    ```python
    for x in prefs:
        prefs[x].reverse()
    ```
:::

## So far

~~~ {.python .lineNumbers}
while len(free_students) > 0:
    s = free_students.pop()
    # if s hasn't proposed to everyone
    if len(prefs[s]) > 0:
        # get the top remaining preference
        h = prefs[s].pop()
~~~

## if h is free
We can translate:

~~~{.numberLines startFrom="4" .python}
if h free:
     add (s, h) to the match
~~~

to

```python
if h not in M:
    M[h] = s
```

## So far
```python
while len(free_students) > 0:
    s = free_students.pop()
    # if s has not proposed to everyone
    if len(prefs[s]) > 0:
        # get the top remaining preference
        h = prefs[s].pop()
        if h not in M:
            M[h] = s
```

## if h not free

~~~ {.numberLines startFrom="6" .python}
   else
     some pair (s2, h) already exists
     if h prefers s to s2
        s2 becomes free
       (s, h) become matched
     else
       (s2, h) remain engaged
~~~

## Current match
To find the current match $(s2, h)$:

```python
s2 = M[h]
```

## Compare rankings
* To compare $h$'s ranking of $s$ and $s2$ we will use an auxillary data structure:

    ```python
    rank = {
        'X': {'A':2, 'B':1, 'C':3},
        'Y': {'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':3},
        'Z': {'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':3}
    }
    ```

* Then we can compare rankings:

    ```python
    rank[h][s] < rank[h][s2]
    ```

## Conditional
* Finally we can translate:

    ~~~{.python .numberLines startFrom="8"}
    if h prefers s to s2
       s2 becomes free
       (s, h) become matched
    else
       (s2, h) remain engaged
    ~~~

* Into

```python
if rank[h][s] < rank[h][s2]:
    M[h] = s
    free_students.append(s2)
else:
    # s is still free
    free_students.append(s) 
```

## Putting it together
```python
while len(free_students) > 0:
    s = free_students.pop()
    # if s has not proposed to everyone
    if len(prefs[s]) > 0:
        # get the top remaining preference
        h = prefs[s].pop()
        if h not in M:
            M[h] = s
        else:
            s2 = M[h]
            if rank[h][s] < rank[h][s2]:
                M[h] = s
                free_students.append(s2)
            else:
                # s is still free
                free_students.append(s)

print(M)
```
